# IP Address Founder

## Project Description
The "IP Address Founder" project is a Java implementation of a Splay Tree data structure for efficiently managing and searching for IP addresses and associated data packets. The Splay Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that reorganizes itself upon each search operation, promoting frequently accessed nodes to the root for faster subsequent searches. This project demonstrates the usage of a Splay Tree to store and manipulate IP addresses along with data packets.

## How the Code Works
The project consists of two main classes:

1. **Node**: Represents a node in the Splay Tree. Each node contains an IP address and data packet information, as well as left and right child nodes, and a parent node reference.

2. **SplayTree**: Implements the Splay Tree data structure, including insertion, searching, and splaying operations. It also provides a method for performing an in-order traversal of the tree.

The `main` method in the `Main` class initializes a Splay Tree and inserts a set of IP addresses into the tree. It then simulates random data packet updates for each IP address. Finally, it performs an in-order traversal of the tree to display the IP addresses and their associated data packets.

## Usage
To run the "IP Address Founder" project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.

2. Open the project in an IDE that supports Java, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

3. Compile and run the `Main` class.

4. You will see the IP addresses and their associated data packets displayed in the console.
